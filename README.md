# Symfony Certification Study Notes
Study notes made whilst preparing for [Symfony 5.0 certification](https://certification.symfony.com/).

## Other very good resources
* [Symfony certification guide](https://github.com/jmolivas/symfony-certification-guide)
* [Symfony Certification Preparation List](https://github.com/ThomasBerends/symfony-certification-preparation-list) by [Thomas Berends](https://github.com/ThomasBerends)
* [Symfony 3 certification guide](https://github.com/raulconti/symfony-3-certification-guide)

## Motivation
The resources above are very good, they take the [list of topics](https://certification.symfony.com/) and link each one to the appropriate page on Symfony.com

In addition to having the pages linked, I wanted to collate the notes I was making whilst studying for the certification exam so I created this resource.
